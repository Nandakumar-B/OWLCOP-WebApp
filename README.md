# OWLCOP-WebApp
* Owl-Cop is an IoT-based project developed to estimate the number of people entering and leaving a building.
* In this Covid-19 situation, it is very difficult to limit peopleâ€™s access to an office like a bank.
* This website, which is connected to the hardware (Arduino or something else) via the Internet, notifies us when the number of people increases beyond the limit.
